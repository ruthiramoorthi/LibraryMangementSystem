📚 Library Management System (LMS)
Project Overview
This is a robust Library Management System (LMS) backend application built using Spring Boot. The system is designed to efficiently manage library resources, patron accounts, and book lending transactions via a clean, secure, and scalable RESTful API.

✨ Key Features
Book Catalog Management: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for books, including details like ISBN, Title, Author, and Stock Quantity.

Patron Management: Securely manage registered library members, including their contact information and lending history.

Lending & Circulation: Dedicated endpoints for checking books out and checking them back in.

Transaction Tracking: Automated tracking of loan dates, due dates, and enforcement of library rules (e.g., loan limit, maximum duration).

RESTful API: Provides standard JSON-based responses for easy integration with any modern frontend framework (React, Angular, etc.).

Data Persistence: Uses a relational database configured via Spring Data JPA.
